# PacMen-Factory
Create a factory of PacMen and start the game to have them move around within the bounds of the page.

## Installation
Download all files onto the same folder

## Usage
Open the html file on your browser. Click add PacMan to create as many PacMen as you want, and then start game to have them bounce back and forth within the bounds of the page.

## Roadmap
As I gain more knowledge in coding, additions and upgrades will be added to this exercise.
